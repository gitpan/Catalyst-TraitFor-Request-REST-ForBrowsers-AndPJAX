NAME
    Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST::ForBrowsers::AndPJAX - Acknowledge
    "PJAX" requests as browser requests

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST::ForBrowsers::AndPJAX - released June
    06, 2012 as part of Catalyst-TraitFor-Request-REST-ForBrowsers-AndPJAX.

SYNOPSIS
        # in your app class
        use CatalystX::RoleApplicator;
        __PACKAGE__->apply_request_class_roles(qw/
            Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST::ForBrowsers::AndPJAX
        /);

        # then, off in an controller somewhere...
        sub action_GET_html { ... also called for PJAX requests ...  }

DESCRIPTION
    This is a tiny little Catalyst::Request class trait that recognizes that
    a PJAX request is also a browser request, and thus looks_like_browser()
    also returns true when the method is GET and the "X-Pjax" header is
    present and is 'true'.

    This allows actions using an action class of REST::ForBrowsers to
    transparently handle PJAX requests, without requiring any more
    modification to the controller or application than applying this trait
    to the request class, rather than plain-old
    Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST::ForBrowsers.

METHODS
  looks_like_browser
    This method is wrapped to return true if the method is GET and the
    "X-Pjax" header is present and is 'true'.

    Otherwise we hand things off to the original method, to render its
    verdict as to the tenor of the request.
